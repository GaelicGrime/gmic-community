  eval (+):
      expression

    Evaluate specified math expression.
     * If no command selection is specified, the expression is evaluated once 
    and its result is set to status.
     * If command selection is specified, the evaluation is looped over 
    selected images. Status is not modified.
      (in this latter case, 'eval' is similar to 'fill' without assigning the 
    image values).
