<p><tt><b>-name</b></tt> labels selections for reference during execution of <tt><b>gmic</b></tt> scripts and for managing layer properties of host applications like Gimp or Krita. Naming conventions differ between these two contexts. See <a target="_parent" href="#HostApplicationUseCase" class="internal">The Host Application Use Case</a> for how <tt><b>-name</b></tt> interacts with host applications which support image layers.</p>
<p>Since this command is frequently used to label selections containing one image, it is easy to misconstrue its purpose to just one of labeling images. As misconstructions go, this is mostly harmless; its malfeasance lies mainly with the mental blocks erected in the minds of gmic script writers who forget the benefits of classifying related images under one meaningful name.</p>
<p>The format of the command is:</p>
<p><tt><b>-name[</b></tt><i>&lt;selection&gt;</i><tt><b>] &ldquo;</b></tt><i>&lt;name&gt;</i><tt><b>&rdquo;</b></tt></p>
<p>The command associates the collection of images referenced by <i>&lt;selection&gt;</i> with the label <i>&lt;name&gt;</i>. The images become members of a<i> named selection</i> that<i> &lt;name&gt;</i> identifies. Its shortcut is <tt><b>-nm</b></tt>,<i><br /></i></p>
<p>Formally, the label <i>&lt;name&gt;</i> may be written with any characters supported by the host computer, but if the intent is to use labels as named selections in <a target="_parent" href="command-decorations.shtml#image_selection" class="internal">command decorators</a> or image parameters, contexts where <strong><tt>[</tt></strong> and <strong><tt>]</tt></strong> selection operators apply, then <strong><tt>gmic</tt></strong> further restricts character usage to the class <tt><b>[a-zA-Z0-9_]</b></tt> and such names cannot begin with a numeric.</p>
<p><tt><b>gmic</b></tt> scripts operating within the context of the host application plug-in may use <tt><b>-name</b></tt> to communicate with the host for setting layer properties, including setting the layer's name in the host application. This host layer name is not the same as the label that <tt><b>-name</b></tt> sets; In fact, the <tt><b>gmic</b></tt> script writer uses <tt><b>-name</b></tt> to label the image with a string composed according to a simple syntax that resembles calling functions. The host application retrieves this <tt><b>gmic</b></tt>-produced label and executes internal functions to set position, layer modes, opacity and the host application layer name, which can be, and usually are, quite different than the gmic label. See <a target="_parent" href="#HostApplicationUseCase" class="internal">The Host Application Use Case</a> for details.</p>
<h2 id="UsageOfNameSelectionOps">Usage of <tt><b>-name</b></tt> with selection operators <strong><tt>[</tt></strong> and <strong><tt>]</tt></strong></h2>
<p>In gmic scripts operating within a host plug-in or in a command shell, <tt><b>-name</b></tt> associates a collection of images selected by the command's <a target="_parent" href="command-decorations.shtml#image_selection" class="internal">right hand decorator</a> with a <em>named selection</em>, identified by the string argument given to name.</p>

<p>The sample image, rose, becomes an image in the named selection <tt><b>BlurMe</b></tt>.

<p>With the insertion of a new item at the beginning of the list, the sole image in the <tt><b>AmpersandMe</b></tt> named selection acquires a new list index of &lsquo;1.&rsquo; Reindexing does not remove it from the <tt><b>AmpersandMe</b></tt> named selection, however, even though the former index of &lsquo;0&rsquo; initially linked this image in the named selection. Nor does the apparent error of &lsquo;naming selection zero twice&rsquo; hold. The ampersand template, loaded from <tt>ampersand.cimg</tt>, becomes included in the &lsquo;<strong><tt>TheAmpStamp</tt></strong>&rsquo; named selection through an independent naming operation. Selections provide for the inclusion of images in named selections just at the moment of creation. Subsequent re-indexing does not change associations. The image created in the first step of this example continues its association with <tt><b>AmpersandMe</b></tt> even as the composition of the image list changes. In light of this, script writers mostly do not have to worry about where images in named selections are on the list, saving much counting on one's fingers.</p>
<h2 id="OneAssociationataTime">One Association at a Time</h2>
<p>An image cannot be associated with more than one named selection at a time. If an image is subsequently enrolled in a different named selection, it loses its association with all previous named selections.</p>

<p>With the inclusion of all images on the list within the named selection <tt><b>Granfalloon</b></tt>, the rose image is no longer a part of <tt><b>BlurMe</b></tt>. Since the rose image is the only member of that named selection, the selection ceased to exist and subsequent references to it raised an exception.

<h2 id="ExampleMultipleImageTracking">Example: Multiple Image Tracking</h2>
<p>The following example illustrates the inclusion of a multiple number of images within single image selections. Without named selections, this example would have been both harder to code and harder to read. In addition to index bookkeeping, named selections let the <tt><b>gmic</b></tt> script writer signal intent through an apt choice of selection names.</p>

<p>The template, <tt><b>ampersand.cimg</b></tt>, is a single channel binary mask with each pel being set to either 0 (background) or 1(foreground). We multiplexed the mask twelve times, leaving thirteen ampersands on the image list, and grouped these into separate selections using the modulo-n (:&lt;<i>n</i>&gt;) selection notation. See <a target="_parent" href="http://gmic.eu/reference.shtml#section6" title="Selections" class="external"><em>1.5 Command Items</em></a> in the <a target="_parent" href="http://gmic.eu/gmic_reference.pdf" title="G'MIC Handbook" class="external"><i>G&rsquo;MIC Handbook</i></a> or <a target="_parent" href="command-decorations.shtml" title="Command Decorations" class="internal"><i>Command Decorations</i></a> at this site for this and other selection notation tricks. The <a target="_parent" href="_input.shtml" title="The -input command" class="internal"><tt><b>-input</b></tt></a> command starting off the script introduces a three channel color map with four swatches, written as an <a target="_parent" href="_input.shtml#ImageSpecification" title="Image Specifications" class="internal"><i>image specification</i></a>, and organized for use with <a target="_parent" href="_map.shtml" title="Color mapping command." class="internal"><tt><b>-map</b></tt></a>. The game is to group these ampersand masks into named selections, one for each color, then pull the members of the various named selections into local image lists, scaling and mapping the masks to the color maps in each locale, scaling the foreground flag (&lsquo;1&rsquo;) into a colormap index. The background flag, (&lsquo;0&rsquo;) scales to itself and selects the background color from the map, which is in slot zero. Citing named selections instead of literal selections eases the complexity of setting up each local image list, the name clearly signaling the intent of the local list.</p>
<h2 id="HostApplicationUseCase">The Host Application Use Case</h2>
<p>When running in the hosted gmic plugin in such applications as Gimp, Krita and similar layer-based graphics applications, filter authors can set the name, opacity, compositing mode, and position of newly exported layers. <tt><b>-name</b></tt> is able to convey a small script to the host application that, when executed, sets pertinent layer attributes. The filter author may also query the host application for current values of a layer's name, opacity, composition mode and position. These are available through a set of gmic commands that are only defined when a gmic script runs in the gmic plugin, and not in a shell environment.</p>
<h2 id="ExampleMapMakerFilter">Example: MapMaker Filter</h2>
<p>The following is a small utility filter which generates a feathered selection mask when given a central color of interest and a selectivity value. Based on the <a target="_parent" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution" class="external">Gaussian distribution curve</a>, selectivity is roughly inversely proportional to variance. Increasing selectivity decreases sigma, narrowing the distribution. Pixels at variance with the central color of interest tend to be excluded with higher selectivity values. The filter harnesses <tt><b>-name</b></tt> to incorporate both the RGB components of the central color of interest and the selectivity setting in the name of the mask, so that the filter user can recreate the mask for a different project or at a later time.</p>
