# store
%% x "mkdir -p img" %%
|![usdoj](images/usdoj_1892.jpg)|''-store'' transfers the selected images to command line variables labeled by one or more string objects given in the command's argument list. These images may be referenced to the variables, and are so removed from the image list.
(except if the prepended variant of the command +store[selection] is used).
If a single variable name is specified, all images of the selection are assigned
to the named variable. Otherwise, there must be as many variable names as images
in the selection, and each selected image is assigned to each specified named variable.
Use command input $variable_name to bring the stored images back in the list.
