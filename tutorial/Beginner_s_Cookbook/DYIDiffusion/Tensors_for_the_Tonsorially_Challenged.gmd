![img](images/init-01.png) Randomness is all well and good, but there are days when we wish for some control over our lives, or at least our G'MIC installations. The question is, can we plot these swirling curves so that they flow in particular directions?

And – of course – the answer is “Yes!!!” Because that's exactly the problem which the anisotropic smoothing bits have to figure out when they are composing a tensor field. At the end of the day, -smooth gets a tensor field which tells it exactly how to directionally blur an image. It's behavior is being managed in a precise way.

Since -diffusiontensors knows how to write those kind of instructions, our course seems to run along the lines of preparing edges or lines in the patterns we'd like to make. The anisotropic smoothing bits will detect the lines and edges in these “guidelines” and build a diffusion tensor field for smooth. We'll then give -smooth an entirely different image to work on. Noise, of course, can be an ideal basis for making hair.
