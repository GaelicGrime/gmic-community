%% original/tigercook.png r2dy 300 %% If you've visited the ''Basics'' page, you might have noticed a gallery of what some G'MIC commands do. They are wonderful, but also atypical, in that they are single commands that create an effect atomically. In typical cases, G'MIC effects arise from a good many commands, arrived at through some (more or less) controlled process of experimentation. G'MIC is a self-extending language, meaning that an especially interesting set of commands can be converted into a single command. This process can go on ad infinitum, with commands building upon other commands. We won't go into that topic in this basic cookbook, but will visit the topic later.

_"Images from Whole Cloth"_ might be the theme of this basic cookbook. All images here are conjured up from random processes ('-rand'), noise makers ('-noise') and the [diamond-square algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond-square_algorithm) (''-plasma''). G'MIC experimentation is invariably iterative, and certain [command line idiomata](command-decorations.shtml#idiomata) help this process. Each recipe here began with an image conjured up from the aether, followed by a random process or two, creating seed images, followed sets of filters, often transforming the seed images into entirely different arrangements.
