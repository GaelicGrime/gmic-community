|![frontimage](images/forfun.png)|The `-for` _<loop scope>_ `-done` commands form a syntactical unit that repeatedly tests the [mathematical_expression](https://gmic.eu/reference/mathematical_expressions.html#top) argument given to `-for` and, if `True,` executes the in-scope commands, if any. The _<loop scope>_ need not be populated and is a placeholder when empty.\n\n`-for`…`-done` expresses a "test, then perform" pattern. With the conditional test at the top of the loop, the in-scope commands won't execute at all if `-for`'s argument first resolves to `False`. For a "perform, then test" pattern. consider ''-do'' … ''-while''.
