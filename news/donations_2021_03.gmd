# Some News About Your Donations

___[ 2021/03/31 ]___

Since March __2019__, we have set up a [donation system](https://libreart.info/en/projects/gmic) for \G'MIC, which allows users who are satisfied with our software to [support us](https://libreart.info/en/projects/gmic) and give some money to the project.  On one hand, this clearly encourages us to continue the development efforts. On the other hand, it could potentially be used in the future to finance the purchase of hardware, travels to conferences related to free software (for presenting the project), and maybe even recruitments of interns to accelerate the development of \G'MIC.

As it was not legally possible for us (the [GREYC laboratory](https://www.greyc.fr) where we develop \G'MIC) to directly accept small donations, we have set up a collaboration with the non-profit organization [LILA](https://libreart.info/en/projects/gmic) (*"Libre Comme l'Art"*), which is able to collect donations and transfer them back to our lab via a "grouped" payment.

You may already know [LILA](https://libreart.info/en/), whose members *Jehan* and *Aryeom* are highly involved in the development and improvement of [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) and who are also the people behind [Ze Marmot](https://film.zemarmot.net/fr/), a project of 2D animation movie, to be released under Creative Common by-SA/Art Libre licenses and fully made with creative Free Software ([GIMP](https://www.gimp.org), [Blender](https://www.blender.org), [Ardour](https://https://ardour.org/)…).

This has been a long time coming, but we are happy to announce that finally, a first transfer of **4500 €** in donations has been made by [LILA](https://libreart.info/en/) to the \G'MIC project this month, corresponding to the donations received since March 2019!

We do not yet know exactly how this money will be used, but we wanted to take this opportunity to thank once again all our supporters who made this funding possible.

Thanks also to *Jehan* from [LILA](https://libreart.info/en/), who accepted to manage the reception of the donations for \G'MIC. Also a special thanks to *Sam* from [FOSSHUB](https://www.fosshub.com/) who is a reccuring donor and who also offers an efficient hosting service for our files to download.

For the moment, we are working on the release of the next version **2.9.7** of \G'MIC (see the current state of the [ _changelog_ ](https://discuss.pixls.us/t/on-the-road-to-3-0/)).

We already had a lot of __exciting news__ lately :

  - A few new image processing filters to play with.
  - Our plug-in G'MIC-Qt is now supported on [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) __2.99__ (development version of GIMP 3), as well as on [Photoshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop), [Affinity Photo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_Photo), and theoretically all 8bf-compatible hosts (thanks to [*Jan Tojnar*](https://github.com/jtojnar) and [*Nicholas Hayes*](https://github.com/0xC0000054) who made this possible!).
  - And of course, a lot of bugfixes (that we do not always make appear in the _changelog_ :) ).

We now focus on the fixing the few remaining bugs, to have a really cool **2.9.7** version to propose soon (hopefully).

#### So, until we can announce the release of this new version, we thank you again!


#### Stay safe!
