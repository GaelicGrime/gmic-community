# About Donations

#### ***[ 2021/03/31 ]***


Since March __2019__, we have set up a [donation system](https://libreart.info/en/projects/gmic) for \G'MIC, which allows users who are satisfied with our software to [support us](https://libreart.info/en/projects/gmic) and send some money to the project.  On one hand, this (clearly) encourages us to continue our development efforts. On the other hand, donations could be used in the future to finance the purchase of hardware, travel to conferences related to free software (e.g. for presenting the advances of the project), or even recruit interns to accelerate further development.

As it was not legally possible for us (the [GREYC laboratory](https://www.greyc.fr) where \G'MIC is developped) to directly accept small donations, we have set up a collaboration with the non-profit organization [LILA](https://libreart.info/en/projects/gmic) (*"Libre Comme l'Art"*), which is able to collect donations and transfer them back to our lab via a "grouped" payment.

You may already know [LILA](https://libreart.info/en/), whose members *Jehan* and *Aryeom* are highly involved in the development and improvement of [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) (_GNU Image Manipulation Program_) and who are also the people behind [ZeMarmot](https://film.zemarmot.net/fr/), a nice project of 2D animation movie, to be released under Creative Common by-SA/Art Libre licenses and fully made with creative Free Software ([GIMP](https://www.gimp.org), [Blender](https://www.blender.org), [Ardour](https://ardour.org/)…).

This has been a long time coming, but we are happy to announce that, finally, a first transfer of **4500 €** of donations has been made by [LILA](https://libreart.info/en/) to the \G'MIC project this month, corresponding to the donations received since March 2019!

We do not yet know exactly how this money will be used, but we wanted to take this opportunity to **thank once again all our supporters** who made this funding possible. The fact is that we can now officially use this budget for the \G'MIC project.

Thanks also to *Jehan* from [LILA](https://libreart.info/en/), who accepted to manage these \G'MIC donations. Also a special thanks to *Sam* from [FOSSHUB](https://www.fosshub.com/), a recurring donor who also offers us an efficient hosting service for the files we provide for downloading.

For now on, we are focused on finalizing the next release of \G'MIC (version **2.9.7**) (see the current state of the [_changelog_](https://discuss.pixls.us/t/on-the-road-to-3-0/)).

We already had a lot of __exciting news__ lately :

  - A bunch of new image filters to play with.
  - Our plug-in G'MIC-Qt is now supported on [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) __2.99__ (development version of GIMP 3), as well as on [Photoshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop), [Affinity Photo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_Photo), and theoretically all _8bf_-compatible hosts (thanks to respectively [*Jan Tojnar*](https://github.com/jtojnar) and [*Nicholas Hayes*](https://github.com/0xC0000054) who made this possible!).
  - And of course, a lot of bugfixes (that we do not always make appear in the _changelog_ due to lack of time :) ).

We are trying to fix the few remaining bugs, in order to have a really cool **2.9.7** version to propose soon (hopefully).

#### Until we can announce the release of this new version, let us **thank you again!**
#### And stay safe!
